# CS Notes - my personal knowledge base

This site is thought of as a home for my notes from various sources: books I've read, concepts I've encountered, videos I've seen. It serves as a reference for me, but I hope it will be of use to someone else as well.

### Developing cheat sheet

I'm developing this site on a MacBook Air with M1, MacOS v12. This serves as a cheat sheet for myself so I don't forget the basic jekyll commands (I don't use this tool at all apart from this project).

Launch development server:
```
bundle exec jekyll server
```
